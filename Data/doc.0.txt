    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Vector Databases

    RAG systems enhance Large Language Models by retrieving relevant data from external sources like ChromaDB or FAISS. 
    By converting documents into vector embeddings, the system can perform semantic searches to find context 
    that a model wasn't originally trained on, reducing hallucinations.
