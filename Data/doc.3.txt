    Natural Language Processing with NLTK and Transformers

    Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves the interaction between computers and human languages. 
    Libraries like NLTK are used for basic tokenization and stop-word removal, while Transformer-based 
    models like BERT or GPT handle complex tasks like sentiment analysis and language translation.
